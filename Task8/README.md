# Task 8: Capture Network Traffic with Wireshark

## Objective
The objective of this task is to capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark and understand HTTP communication between client and server.

## Tool Used
- Wireshark

## Steps Performed
1. Installed Wireshark with Npcap.
2. Selected active network interface (Wi-Fi).
3. Captured live network traffic.
4. Generated HTTP traffic by visiting websites.
5. Applied HTTP display filter.
6. Analyzed packets and saved capture file.

## Packet Analysis
The captured packets include:
- HTTP GET requests
- HTTP responses (Status Code 200 OK)
- Source and destination IP addresses
- TCP port numbers
- User-Agent details

## Files Included
- wireshark_capture.pcap – Packet capture file
- README.md – Documentation of the task

## Conclusion
This task helped in understanding how network traffic flows and how HTTP communication works using packet-level analysis in Wireshark.
